# Toroidal-Energy-Harvesting

The **Toroidal-Energy-Harvesting Dataset** was created to support research on energy harvesting solutions. It contains extensive data collected from a comprehensive experimental setup and aims to facilitate advancements in energy harvesting by providing high-quality data. This dataset contains 1,300 rows and 6 columns, designed for regression tasks related to power prediction. It includes five input features (Core Number, Line Current, Load, VLoad, and IWinding) and one output variable (Power). Detailed descriptions of the parameters, experimental setup, and data collection conditions are provided in the accompanying introductory paper below.
